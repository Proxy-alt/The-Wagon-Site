            <summary><b>Bookmarklets Not Working</b></summary>
            You may have messed something up with the bookmarklet, so try remaking it. Be sure that the beginning is "javascript:" If it still doesn’t work, bookmarklets are likely disabled. In that case, use Blobe BM, Snap&Run if you have Snap&Read, or uRun if you have uBlock Origin.

            <summary><b>Exploit Not Working</b></summary>
            Make sure you read & follow all the instructions before assuming something is wrong. If something is wrong, you may have messed something up, so try it again. If you did everything correctly & it still doesn’t work, it might be patched on your current version of Chrome OS. To check your current version, go to Settings & select “About Chrome OS” at the bottom of the left panel. If it’s not patched & it still doesn’t work, check the other requirements. Things like bookmarklets may be disabled.

                <summary><b>LTMEAT Not Working</b></summary>
                Depending on the method of LTMeat you’re using, it will be patched on Chrome OS 115+. Check your current version using the instructions above. To determine if your method might be patched, check whether it uses the chrome://kill &/or chrome://hang commands. If so, it might be patched. If LTMEAT isn’t patched, continue on.

                    <summary><b>Main, Backup, & Skid Methods</b></summary>
                    Check bookmark (A). You may have messed something up. Double check the extension ID you used. Make sure to delete the words “ID”. If that doesn’t work, remake (A). If it still doesn’t work, get the ID from the extension page & contact me if it works. If you copy+pasted the template URL, you should be ashamed of yourself. If (A) is correct, you’ll see a bunch of code. If (A) isn’t the issue, remake (B) & (C). Make sure (B) is chrome://kill & (C) is chrome://hang. If your bookmarks are correct, make sure you’re also spam reloading. If you are, make sure you take less than 3 seconds to start spamming. If everything is correct, spam faster. If that still doesn’t work, spam longer.

                    <summary><b>Temp Method</b></summary>
                    Make sure memory saver is turned off. If that doesn’t work, check the folder (spam.js) to make sure it has the correct amount of bookmarks. If it does, check the bookmarks. Make sure you’re using the template URL in the Temporary Method section (the end should be background.js instead of manifest.json). If that doesn’t fix it, make sure you open 2 batches. Be sure to wait for the popup & duplicate the rightmost tab, & make sure you delete all tabs to the right of the leftmost tab. If your computer/browser completely crashes, try uing less tabs.

            <summary><b>Hack Not Working</b></summary>
            Make sure you read & follow all the instructions before assuming something is wrong. If something is wrong, you may have messed something up, so try it again. If you did everything correctly & it still doesn’t work, see if there's an updated version. If it’s up to date & it still doesn’t work, check the requirements, as things like bookmarklets may be disabled. If nothing works, the hack is broken. Contact me if that's the case.

            <summary><b>Sites are Still Blocked</b></summary>
            Not everything is blocked using extensions. Look at the blocked screen. If the blocked screen is from your browser itself, use a different method. If it’s from your blocker, check if you successfully completed the exploit. If you didn’t, try it again.

            <summary><b>How do I Know I Completed an Exploit?</b></summary>
            It depends on the exploit, but generally (most) sites will be unblocked.

                <summary><b>How do I Know I Completed LTMEAT?</b></summary>
                One way is to go back on (A). If it hangs (doesn’t load), you did it correctly. Another way is to go on a blocked website & see if it’s unblocked.

            <summary><b>How do I Press Function Keys (F1-F12) on a Chromebook?</b></summary>
            You can enable it in Device » Keyboard » Treat top-row keys as function keys or connect a keyboard with function keys. Note that for SH1MMER, you can press the key that would correspond to the function key (-> instead of F2).

            <summary><b>Where are the i-Ready Hacks?</b></summary>
            Long ago, during the golden age of i-Ready hacking, all you needed to get an instant 100% on a lesson was a simple bookmarklet. However, i-Ready wasn't ok with this. So they patched it. Of course, the hacking community found a way around this by using extensions, but i-Ready made more patches. Eventually, all the hacks disappeared for years. However, years after the death of i-Ready hacks, one team managed to make i-Ready hacks again. Their name was Sapphire. Unfortunately, they had a falling out & i-Ready patched their hacks.

            A proxy acts as the middleman between a client & a server, bypassing network restrictions. In other words, a website that unblocks websites.

            <summary><b>What is Dev Mode (Chrome OS)?</b></summary>
            Dev Mode is a mode in which your Chromebook turns off virus protection & gives you more features, such as the ability to sideload APK files (download apps not off of the play store), enable USB booting, & much more. You can enable it by entering Recovery Mode (Esc+Refresh+Power), then Ctrl+D. Note that Dev Mode & Extension Dev Mode are different things.

            <summary><b>What is Extension Dev Mode?</b></summary>
            Extension Dev Mode is a mode that allows you to load extensions from files. You can enable it by toggling the switch in the "manage extensions" page. Note that Dev Mode & Extension Dev Mode are different things, & that Extension Dev Mode is present in browsers on any OS while Dev Mode is a Chrome OS exclusive (although there are similar things on other operating systems).
